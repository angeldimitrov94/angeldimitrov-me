        <h2>Angel Dimitrov - Software Engineer</h2>
        <h5>Nexus EOL (side/weekend project in progress)</h5>
        <p><i>nexus - noun - nex·​us ˈnek-səs : CONNECTION, LINK</i></p>
        <p><i>EOL = end-of-line, describes the final manufacturing test performed on an assembled manufactured product
                at the end of the assembly line</i></p>
        <h6>What does it do?</h6>
        <p>An aggregator and central connection hub for manufacturing test data (hence 'Nexus').
            When a product is tested by a manufacturer, said test status and data is sent to the platform.
            Pushes of data to the platform can trigger subsequent logic, such as back-office operations.</p>
        <h6>What issue does it solve?</h6>
        <p>Manufacturing processes sometimes suffer from being woefully disconnected.
            The amount of data available can offer tremendous value, IF it is captured.
            The platform is specifically tailored to make it easy for manufacturing testing teams to send their data
            to a centralized location where various stake-holders can access it from the web, as opposed to various
            random
            bits of data being stored away on scattered machines across multiple networks and with varying formats.
        </p>
        <h6>What does the software implementation of the platform look like?</h6>
        <p>The project consists of multiple logically-separated containerized
            Node.Js microservices working with a MongoDB database and a client-rendered Vue.Js front-end.
            It employs a multi-tenant architecture for logically separating multiple accounts'/users' data from
            each other within the same common data store, which brings value at reasonable compute cost.
        </p>
